# FinalProject
This is a fully functional website to tell people more about my home town, Belo Horizonte, in the state of Minas Gerais Brazil. 
I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the website, as well as, a temperature ( celsius/fahrenheit) and a currency(dolar/euros to reais) converter.
There are still many places and activities that will be included in this website as my knowledge in programing increases, so in many ways it is still a project under construction.
